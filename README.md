# ros2-iron-docker

## Setup

You can use [`devcontainer`](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-dev-containers) to setup the development environment.

Before start, you need to clone this repository and pre-setup by running the following command:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/NITIC-Robot-Club/ros2-iron-docker.git"
cd "ros2-iron-docker"
cp ".env.template" ".env"
```

You need to press `Shift` + `Cmd` (`Ctrl`) + `P`, and type `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...`. Then, select the root directory of this repository.
Now all you have to do is sit back and wait! (This process takes a very long time, so please be patient. üçµ)
